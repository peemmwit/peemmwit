## Yo! I’m Peak 🎮
Just a dude who games hard and codes harder...<br>
💻 On the grind to become a full-stack dev — slow & steady vibes<br>
🛠️ Love messing around with random side projects, just for the fun of it<br>
🍜 Night owl life: late-night code, cup noodles, and chill Lo-Fi beats on repeat<br>
<br>
Still learning, still leveling up...
